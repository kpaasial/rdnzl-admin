# Script for updating the host using the build(7) results
# from a buildjail.

# Two modes of operation.

# First mode runs the 'make installkernel' part of the update
# procedure. Also records the installed kernel version with 
# ZFS user properties on the root filesystem.

# TODO: Explore the usefulness of recording of sha256 hash of the
# installed kernel into the ZFS user properties. A mismatch would mean
# that 'make installkernel' has been run and /boot/kernel/kernel has changed. 

# TODO: Guarantee atomicity of the operation. Either both the kernel
# gets installed successfully and the ZFS property operations are
# finished or the operations get rolled back to the initial state 
# in case of any error. 


# Second mode is run after update of world to record the installed
# world version using another set of ZFS user properties
# on the root filesystem.



# The mode can be autodetected by looking at the ZFS user
# properties on the ZFS root filesystem. If the recorded 
# ${SVNREVISION} of the kernel is less than what is on the
# sources it can be deduced that this script hasn't been
# yet run in the first mode to install the new kernel.
#
# Otherwise the second mode should be used.

# Include common functions and settings
