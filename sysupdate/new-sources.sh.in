# Script for automatically mounting a new set of sources in a build jail.
# This is run after using svn/svnlite to update the sources.

# Creates a snapshot of the sources and a ZFS clone using the
# snapshot and mounts the clone on the desired jail under the jail
# /usr/src -directory.

# After running this script 'make buildworld buildkernel'
# followed by the usual update procedure should be run on the
# host. The script update-host automates this procedure as much
# as possible. 
  
# After the host has been updated with new kernel and world using
# the update-host.sh script the build jail should be updated by
# running the update-buildjail.sh script.

# TODO: I have a feeling this should be called something else. This
# doesn't quite "set up" a build jail but does the set up of new
# sources for building a new set of object files to be used for updates.

# TODO: Write a script to automate the buildworld/buildkernel procedure.

# TODO: Add a way to bootstrap a buildjail (any possible branch/version
# based on the build host version) using a release distribution or a
# snapshot from ftp.freebsd.org. Create a new script perhaps for this bootstrap
# procedure.
